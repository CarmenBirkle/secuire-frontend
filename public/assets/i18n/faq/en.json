  "FAQ1": "What is a password manager?",
  "FAQ1-A":"A password manager is a software or service used to securely store passwords and other confidential information. It acts as a digital locker where users can centrally manage their passwords for various online accounts and services. The basic function of a password manager is to help users create, store and retrieve strong, unique passwords for various websites and services. Instead of having to remember multiple passwords or use simple, easy-to-guess passwords, users can use a password manager to generate and store complex and unique passwords for each account. A password manager usually provides an encrypted database or vault where passwords are stored securely. The user only needs to remember a single master password to gain access to the password manager and the stored passwords. The password manager encrypts the data and protects it from unauthorized access. Using a password manager is a good security practice as it helps to use strong, unique passwords and reduce the risk of password theft and account compromise. However, it is important to choose a strong master password and make sure that the password manager itself is well protected to ensure the security of the stored passwords.",
